# Mobile security requires new methods

Mobile endpoints differ from traditional endpoints in a number of ways.
Lack of administrative, or “root,” access
* Complex, drawn-out patching cycles for device updates
* Operating system (OS) access-control that limits the functionality of security apps
* Constant connectivity, frequently traversing insecure and untrusted networks 
* A broad attack surface spanning devices, apps, and back-end services and infrastructure

The traditional, malware-focused approach to network security does not translate to mobile. According to Verizon’s 2015 Data Breach Investigations Report, only “an average of 0.03% of smartphones per week—out of tens of millions of mobile devices on the Verizon network—were infected with ‘higher-grade’ malicious code.”<sup>[8](http://www.verizonenterprise.com/DBIR/2015/)</sup> Focusing on malicious apps leaves out too many important aspects of mobile security.

We founded NowSecure on a different approach to mobile security, which we call [the SCAN Principle](https://www.nowsecure.com/blog/2014/12/01/the-scan-principle-of-mobile-security/). SCAN stands for System, Configuration, Apps and Network. System vulnerabilities include security flaws in mobile operating systems. Configuration vulnerabilities include, for example, a device that does not require a passcode for access or is jailbroken. App vulnerabilities consist of risky apps prone to man-in-the-middle attacks or apps that store sensitive information insecurely or send data unencrypted. Finally, network vulnerabilities include insecure Wi-Fi connections that might allow an attacker to intercept traffic from a device.
