# Games

The Google Play store defines 17 distinct games categories. Weâ€™ve aggregated our findings across those categories into a single Games category here. Game apps feature in-app purchases, present ads to users, and save user information as a profile for playing specific games.

We tested 56,964 apps within the Games category. We find that 5.2 games apps are installed  on the average device. Our findings show that game apps are 1.5 times more likely to have at least one high risk vulnerability than the average app. File system issues are present in 17.1 percent of games apps compared to 13.3 percent in all apps. 

What concerns us most about the game apps is that 32.8 percent of apps in the category leak sensitive data, which is three times as much as the average mobile app. Game apps are also nine times more likely than the average app to have a network issue.
