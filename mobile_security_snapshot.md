# Mobile security snapshot

We’ve structured our report to highlight our findings across each domain of NowSecure’s SCAN Principle for mobile security. Much of the data comes from our proprietary collection of mobile security data, statistics and trends. Our NowSecure Intelligence database gathers and correlates more than 140 million data points each day from users of our NowSecure Protect app in more than 180 countries. The app performs anonymous, non-invasive security assessments of the mobile device on which it’s installed. This trove of data highlights device health trends, mobile device security across regions, operating systems in use, vulnerability prevalence, and the IP addresses to which devices connect with or without permission.<sup>[9](https://www.nowsecure.com/intelligence/)</sup>

In section IV, “Detailed app findings,” we dive deep into an analysis of vulnerabilities in more than 400,000 apps available on the Google Play app store. We tested these apps at scale using our own dynamic analysis system that performs automated analysis of iOS and Android applications at scale.<sup>[10](https://www.nowsecure.com/blog/2015/12/17/finding-mobile-vulnerabilities-at-scale/)</sup>
