# A Note on App Containerization

App containerization involves storing encrypted data on a mobile device within an encrypted storage “container” separate from other data and apps on the device. Access to the container requires authentication making it inaccessible without valid credentials. IT teams can then control business data separate from personal data on employee devices. Containerization also has benefits beyond control of data: organizations can wipe container data, revoke access to specific data, fulfill industry and regulatory compliance requirements, manage multiple types of devices and platforms, and increase employee access to important data.

App containerization alone should not be counted on to protect mobile endpoints, however, as it’s only one piece of a secure mobile ecosystem. Containerization software has substantial costs to install and maintain, and requires users to go through additional steps to access needed data, which can result in a poor user experiences and abandonment. In addition, app containerization, if relied upon alone, can serve as a single point of failure: a secure container on an insecure mobile device yields an insecure container. For more information about app containerization and where it might fit into your mobile security strategy, see the NowSecure whitepaper, “[Four Myths of Containerization](https://info.nowsecure.com/containerization-four-myths/).”
