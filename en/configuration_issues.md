# Configuration issues

Users and how they configure their devices can also threaten the security of enterprises. A user can compromise security, compounding risk when insecure apps are involved. For example, we find that 43 percent of mobile users do not use a passcode, PIN, or pattern lock on their device. If a user doesnâ€™t enable one of these security features and someone steals or finds the device, they would have mostly unfettered access to the data on the device, including SMS messages, emails, geo-location data, and photos. Most security features on a mobile device, including encryption and remote wipe, is ultimately dependent on having set a user passcode.

Other configuration issues can impact device security, including encryption settings, the enablement of USB debugging, and apps installed from unknown sources. Altogether the configuration plays a key part in activating the security capabilities of the mobile OS.
