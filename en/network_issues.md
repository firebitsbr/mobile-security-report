# Network issues

One of mobile’s most beneficial aspects, continual connectivity, is also one of its greatest weaknesses. Our data shows that half of mobile devices connect to unsecured Wi-Fi each month, which exposes devices to data loss and manipulation. Even if a device connects to the Internet using a secure connection, it’s astonishing to note all of the connections devices and apps make with servers around the world. The average mobile device connects to approximately 160 unique servers every day. Any one of those connections could expose your enterprise to risk. In addition, 35 percent of the data transmitted via those connections is unencrypted.
