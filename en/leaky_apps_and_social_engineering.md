# Leaky apps and social engineering

Any piece of personal data leaked by a mobile app should concern us all because itâ€™s an invasion of privacy. However, the information that a mobile app might leak can prove valuable to attackers in multiple ways. 

Personal data leaked by multiple apps can be used as reconnaissance information to be used in social engineering schemes. For example, if the user is targeted, credentials leaked by a productivity app might grant an attacker access to a cache of sensitive information. A hacker can potentially obtain a username and GPS location, allowing them to unlock other sensitive information about a user.
